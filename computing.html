                        Computing: There isn't much to go on here, but I am well versed in java. It is my prefered language when ever I code for fun or do a project on my own. 
                        I have experience using C and C++, I would say of the two oddly enough That I am better at C. I have minimal experience using assembly, I am not confident
                        at all when it comes to assembly, however I would say I could hone my skills very easily. One language I would like to learn is python due to its simplicity.
