                            <p>I've had a lot of experience playing all kinds of sports and physical activity.
                            I played football for four years in high school as well as four years of wrestling.
                            I currently play basketball every-day, in addition to that I also play soccer.
                            If I have time to do so at the end of everyday I like to workout in the gym.
                            I typically alternate between upper-body and lower-body from day to day.
                            If you want to contact me to shoot some hoops or play soccer please see description tab in the
                            Main Menu.
